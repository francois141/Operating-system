# Operating_System

## My Operating system written from scratch

This is my first operating system written from scratch. It is certainly not very powerful and it probably has several bugs but it allowed me to learn the basics of an operating system and drivers.

I am currently coding a second operating system. 

### Current features of the operating system 

* Protected mode
* Screen driver 
* Keyboard driver
* Ata driver
* Pci driver
* Shell
* Timer & sleep_function
* Basic math library
* Basic graphics library
* Beep driver
* Snake

## Features of the next os

* Virtual memory
* Multitasking
* Paging
* User mode
* ELF Loading
* SVGA
* GUI & 3d Engine
